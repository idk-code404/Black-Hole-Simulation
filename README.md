Physics Simulation Details
The simulation implements several key concepts from general relativity:

Event Horizon: The point of no return where escape velocity exceeds light speed

Photon Sphere: Region where photons orbit the black hole in unstable paths

Accretion Disk: Superheated matter spiraling inward due to angular momentum conservation

Gravitational Lensing: Light bending around massive objects due to spacetime curvature

Spaghettification: Tidal forces stretching objects as they approach the singularity
